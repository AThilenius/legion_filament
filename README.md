# Legion Filament

This is an experiment to see what using Google Filament (via
[filament-rs](https://github.com/AThilenius/filament-rs)) is like from Rust, in
the context of a Legion-based ECS. Windowing is done with `winit`.

## Building

```sh
# Filament deps will be downloaded and unpacked by `filament-rs`.
cargo build
```
